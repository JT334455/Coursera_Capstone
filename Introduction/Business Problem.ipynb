Some injuries can also lead individuals blind, paralyzed, or amputated. With the number of accidents and deaths rising, it is imperative to improve road safety and reduce the number of occurances by developing a prediction model to predict car accidents severity. "

Decreasing the number of accidents can also decrease the chances of unnecessary traffic jam and the cost of  innocent lives."
